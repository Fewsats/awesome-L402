## Protocol

The [L402 protocol](https://l402.org), created by [Lightning Labs](https://lightning.engineering), serves as a framework, facilitating service providers in securing their services with a payment gateway.

This setup allows clients to seamlessly transact and gain access to the respective resources. Essentially, it bridges the gap between payment requirements and resource accessibility, streamlining the process for both service providers and their customers.

When a client requests a resource without a valid access token, the server responds with an incomplete token and a Lightning Network invoice for payment. Once the client pays the invoice and obtains a proof of payment, they combine this with the incomplete token to create a valid access token. This complete token, when presented in a subsequent request, is independently verified by the server, confirming the payment and granting access without needing external validation.
